# ShoppingList
Shopping List that allows adding or removing items with a graphical user interface.

The purpose of this form is to allow the user to add and remove items from their shopping list.  Each entry has a check box next to it, allowing for bool operators to determine which entries to remove when it comes time. This program doesn't inlcude prices for items or anything special, it's just a simple form to keep track of groceries.  I might come back through later on and update the program, but I am satisfied with the logic I included in it for now.
